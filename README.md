This repository contains the source code for a GitHub User Search App. The app allows users to search for GitHub users and view their profiles.

This project is an exercise from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/) and belongs to them. I coded the solution based on the provided design.

### Features:

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for GitHub users by their username.
- **User Profiles**: View detailed profiles of GitHub users, including their repositories, followers, and following.

### Technologies Used:

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend development technologies for building the user interface and implementing client-side functionality.
- **GitHub API**: Utilized to fetch user data and display it within the application.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for styling and layout purposes to enhance the user interface.
